Source Maps are enabled by default during development. During production builds, they are disabled to prevent you leaking your source on the client, unless you specifically opt-in with the configuration flag.

Next.js provides a configuration flag you can use to enable browser source map generation during the production build:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  productionBrowserSourceMaps: true,
}
```

When the `productionBrowserSourceMaps` option is enabled, the source maps will be output in the same directory as the JavaScript files. Next.js will automatically serve these files when requested.

* Adding source maps can increase `next build` time
* Increases memory usage during `next build`
