Enabling `skipProxyUrlNormalize` lets [Proxy](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/proxy) see the original request instead of Next.js's normalized version. This includes internal URLs, query parameters, and headers used during client-side navigation.

**Most projects don't need this option.** It is one of the [advanced Proxy flags](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/proxy#advanced-proxy-flags), meant for specific routing cases and debugging.

```ts filename="next.config.ts" switcher
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  skipProxyUrlNormalize: true,
}

export default nextConfig
```

```js filename="next.config.js" switcher
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  skipProxyUrlNormalize: true,
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

## Reference

During client-side navigation, Next.js uses an internal request rather than requesting the destination URL as a full document load. By default, Next.js normalizes that request before it reaches Proxy, so Proxy sees the same destination URL for both client-side navigation and a full page load.

Next.js also normalizes what Proxy returns, so any URL you rewrite or redirect to is rewritten to match.

With `skipProxyUrlNormalize: true`, neither normalization runs. Proxy receives the request as sent, and the destinations it rewrites or redirects to are sent as written:

| Default                                                                                                                                                                              | With `skipProxyUrlNormalize: true`        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `request.nextUrl` resolves the internal data URL back to the route path and extracts the locale                                                                                      | Holds the requested pathname as sent      |
| `request.url` is the normalized URL                                                                                                                                                  | Is the original request URL               |
| The internal `_rsc` query parameter is stripped                                                                                                                                      | Preserved                                 |
| Next.js internal navigation headers (`rsc`, `next-router-state-tree`, `next-router-prefetch`, `next-router-segment-prefetch`, `next-hmr-refresh`) are removed from `request.headers` | Preserved                                 |
| `NextResponse.rewrite()` destinations are re-serialized with the build ID                                                                                                            | Sent as written                           |
| `NextResponse.redirect()` `Location` is rewritten to a relative URL                                                                                                                  | Sent as written, trailing slash preserved |
| With [`trailingSlash: true`](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/trailingSlash), a trailing slash is appended before Proxy runs                                            | Pathname passed through unchanged         |

### Deprecated alias

The former name of this option is `skipMiddlewareUrlNormalize`, from when Proxy was called Middleware. It still works and logs a deprecation warning. Setting both at once throws:

```bash filename="Terminal"
Config options `skipProxyUrlNormalize` and `skipMiddlewareUrlNormalize` cannot be set at the same time. Please use `skipProxyUrlNormalize` instead.
```

The [version 16 codemod](/docs/app/guides/upgrading/codemods#160) renames it for you.

## Good to know

* Avoid using the internal navigation headers to return different content for client-side navigation and full page loads.
* You do not need this option to limit which routes Proxy runs on. The [`matcher`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/proxy#matcher) config still matches the destination URL either way.
* Only the request and response Proxy sees change. Filesystem routing, `redirects`, and `rewrites` from `next.config.js` behave the same.

## Examples

### Reading the URL as the client sent it

During client-side navigation, Next.js adds an `_rsc` query parameter and its internal navigation headers to the request. With the option enabled, Proxy can read both.

```ts filename="proxy.ts" switcher
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

export default function proxy(request: NextRequest) {
  console.log(request.nextUrl.searchParams.get('_rsc'))
  // Enabled: the value Next.js added to the request
  // Disabled: null

  console.log(request.headers.get('rsc'))
  // Enabled: '1' during client-side navigation
  // Disabled: null
}
```

```js filename="proxy.js" switcher
export default function proxy(request) {
  console.log(request.nextUrl.searchParams.get('_rsc'))
  // Enabled: the value Next.js added to the request
  // Disabled: null

  console.log(request.headers.get('rsc'))
  // Enabled: '1' during client-side navigation
  // Disabled: null
}
```
